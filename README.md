# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Load the subject, activity and features data
Combine the training and test rows for subject, activity and features respectively
Set names for the subject, activity and features variables
Merge subject, activity and features columns to create one data set
Get only columns with mean or std in their names so as to get the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Load the activity labels data and match the activity value with the activity labels
Label the features data with descriptive variable names
Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and each activity.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
